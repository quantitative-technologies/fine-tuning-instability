## Fine-Tuning Instability for Large Language Models


This repository contains the implementation for the `AdamWL2SP` optimizer, as 
described in this [blog post](http://notyetavalable.net).
`AdamWL2SP` is Adaptive Momentum (Adam) with \\(L^2-\mathrm{SP}\\) regularization with
decoupled weight decay.
